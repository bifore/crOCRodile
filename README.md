# crOCRodile : The modern OCR

crOCRodile is a wonderful OCR software allowing you to transform pictures of text into text through the sheer power of our tears and suffering !

It is built on top of the C language and the GTK3 library.

## Features
- Import any file-format images (if supported by GTK3)
- Automatically detect text
- Automatically crops the image around the text using state-of-the-art algorithms
- Automatically rotates your image to suppress the usual annoying shift of normal pictures
- Uses a powerful back-propagating neural network to learn from the text so even if the detection did not work out of the box you can easily help it and it will learn from your corrections.

## Price
It only costs your soul and the sacrifice of your fattest lamb to God.
